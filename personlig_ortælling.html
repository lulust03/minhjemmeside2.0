            <p>My story begins in a land that was once my home. My name is Fatima Chehade, and I was born in Palestine at a time when the world around me was collapsing. My earliest memories are shrouded in turmoil and fear—shadows of rebellion and a land torn from us. I lost my parents when I was still a little girl. No childhood should be filled with so much loss.</p>
            <p>After their death, I was alone, with only my uncle to care for me while we lived amid the chaos. The land I knew turned to ruins, and we had to flee. We reached Lebanon. But there, we were not welcome. Palestinian refugees were looked down upon, and I quickly learned that it was dangerous to reveal who I was. I hid my identity, my people, and my story. They called us unwanted. Every day, I lived in fear of being discovered and the constant shame of having to conceal my heritage.</p>
            <p>As a refugee, we were shuffled around in systems that could not bear us, that did not help us. I was just a child, but my life already felt destroyed.</p>

            <p>At the age of 15, I was married off. It was not out of love. It was a necessity—I was a young girl, alone and unprotected in a world that viewed Palestinian women as weak and vulnerable. I still remember the feeling of fear and uncertainty when I married a man I barely knew. But what could I do? We had no choice. There were no options for another life, no way back to the land that had been taken from us.</p>
            <p>We had four children together. Each child was a source of both hope and fear. My sons grew up with war as their companion. My daughter, Gadah, my beautiful Gadah, was taken from me when she was only 28. I lost her in a world of endless conflict. It felt as if all the pain and loss I had carried over the years gathered in that moment. And yet, I had to keep standing because my other children needed me.</p>
            <p>I survived the Sabra and Shatila massacre. I witnessed innocent people slaughtered, and once again, my people were the target of brutality that no one could understand. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the screams and the blood. And even though I survived, it felt as if I no longer lived. I had no roots left, no base.</p>
            <p>But even here, in exile, I refuse to forget. I refuse to let my story and my people's story be silenced.</p>
