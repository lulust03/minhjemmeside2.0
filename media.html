    <div class="text">
        <h2>Euphemism vs. Direct Language</h2>
        <p>Western media frequently use euphemistic terms like "operations" or "military actions" to describe Israeli offensives, which can downplay the severity of attacks on Palestinians. In contrast, Middle Eastern outlets use more explicit language, such as "massacres" or "genocide," which directly convey the nature and impact of these events</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Dehumanization and Passive Voice </h2>
        <p>The use of passive voice in Western media reports can obscure who is responsible for the violence, creating the impression that Palestinians are "dying" instead of being "killed" by Israeli forces. This contrasts with Middle Eastern media, which often emphasize who is carrying out the attacks and the direct human cost</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Framing the Conflict</h2>
        <p>Western news outlets often frame the conflict as a “war” between two equal sides, masking the disproportionate power dynamics and military capabilities. This framing can portray Israel as a victim defending itself, rather than as an occupying power. Meanwhile, Middle Eastern media highlight the imbalance in power and the systemic oppression faced by Palestinians</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>Coverage Discrepancies</h2>
        <p>Studies show that Western media often allocate less coverage to Palestinian suffering, while Middle Eastern outlets provide more detailed reports. For example, Western coverage tends to focus on Hamas’ actions more frequently, labeling them as “crimes against humanity,” while Israeli attacks are framed in less condemning terms</p>
    </div>


    <div class="text">
        <h2>Public Sentiment and Media Narratives</h2>
        <p>Western media often prioritize Israeli narratives and downplay Palestinian voices, which influences public opinion and shapes political discourse. Middle Eastern media, on the other hand, emphasize the Palestinian perspective, detailing the human impact and historical context more thoroughly</p>
